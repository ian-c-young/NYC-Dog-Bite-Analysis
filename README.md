# NYC-Dog-Bite-Analysis

** THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS **

This project connects to an API to pull data on dog bites in NYC into R. The goal is to report general trends in the data, map the dog bites, and forecast future dog bites. To accomplish this skills like connecting to an API (package: httr2), wrangling the data (packages: dplyr, lubridate, tidyr etc.), statistical analysis of the data (packages: tidymodels, modeltime, etc.), and presentation of the data (packages: ggplot, gt, etc.) were used.

The project was compiled with Quarto in PDF format.
